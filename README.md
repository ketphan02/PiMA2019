# PiMA2019
I was luckily enrolled in a summer camp whose name is PiMA which stands for Project in Mathematics and Applications. Throughout 2 weeks of learning advanced math, I haven't understood almost anything. In the last 3 days, I finally had a chance to create a model, which I have waited to do. At the first stage, it was terrible (mostly because of me) therefore our group report was less completed.
That's why I've tried to fix this and finally it is ready to use. I'm so proud of it and want to share it to everyone.
